## Overview

The project aims to develop a machine learning-based lung cancer detection system leveraging CT scan images to assist physicians in identifying potentially malignant nodules. The key goals are to:

1. **Reduce false-positive rates** in cancer detection.
2. **Enhance diagnostic accuracy and efficiency.**
3. Support **early lung cancer diagnosis**, reducing physicians' workload.
